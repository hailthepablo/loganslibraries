# Logan's Libraries

This repository contains a few small Python libraries/modules that I've created for use in some of my other programs. If you clone a program that uses them or want to use them yourself, paste the following into your .bashrc file:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/loganslibraries"
```
